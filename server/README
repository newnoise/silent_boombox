Silent Boombox Sync Server API
==============================

This is a basic REST API that manages synchronization for the Silent Boombox app.

The control flow looks something like this:

* User A starts app and logs into Spotify
* User A clicks the 'DJ' button
    * App sends a POST /boombox message to the server to create a new boombox resource.
* User A is prompted to add listeners to the boombox.

* User B starts app and logs into Spotify
* User B clicks the 'Listen' button
    * App polls GET /boombox to obtain a boombox id (and spotify song id)
    * When a boombox id is returned, the display is updated to indicate that the User's been added to the boombox.
    * When the song ID is returned, go to Buffering and Syncing 

* User A adds a listener (User B) based on a Spotify User's login, username, or email (TODO - right now just spotify User name)
    * App sends a POST /listener message to the server with the listener's spotify id and the boombox id from the previous request
* Repeat above step as needed
* User A clicks "Done adding listeners"

* App pings Spotify for a song selection kind of thing.  Or searches for a song, or something.
* User A selects a song
    * App sends POST /song to the server with the boombox id.  The server then includes this when listeners ping GET /boombox
    * App also begins the Buffering and Sycing process


Buffering and Syncing:
* App uses returned song ID to begin buffering a song from Spotify
* When enough of a buffer is established, the app calls POST /buffered to the server to indicate it's ready for syncing
* App polls GET /sync until a UTC start time is returned

* Each listener (including the DJ) should receive the same UTC, and will start playing the buffer at that time.
